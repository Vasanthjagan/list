                <u>Background:</u><p>
                    =>Cricket is one of the oldest and most popular sports in the world, with a rich history dating back several centuries. It originated in England during the 16<sup>th</sup> century, possibly as a children's game, and evolved into a major sport over time.
By the 17<sup>th</sup> century, cricket was being played by adults and had gained popularity in the English countryside.<br>

                    <u>Foundation:</u><p>
                        =>The foundation of cricket dates back to the 16th century in England, where it is believed to have been played by children in the rural countryside, especially in the southeast counties like Kent and Sussex.

                            =>After its foundation in England, cricket saw rapid expansion during the 18<sup>th</sup> and 19<sup>th</sup> centuries, especially due to British colonialism. The British Empire played a major role in spreading the game to its colonies.Cricket was introduced by British merchants in the early 1700s. By the 1800s, Indians began forming their own clubs. India played its first Test match in 1932.<br>

                <u>Tournament format:</u><p>
                    =>Cricket tournaments are played in different formats depending on the type of match <i>(Test, ODI, or T20)</i>and the level of competition (domestic, international, or franchise-based). Each format has its own rules for organizing matches, points, and eliminations.

                        =>Here’s a detailed explanation of Player Acquisition, Squad Composition, and Salaries in Cricket, especially useful for understanding franchise-based tournaments like the Indian Premier League (IPL) or other T20 leagues (such as BBL, PSL, etc.).In professional cricket leagues, players are selected through various systems. These systems are designed to ensure fairness, team balance, and financial control.<br>

                        <u>Match rules:</u><p>
                            =>Cricket is a <strong>sport played between two teams of 11 players</strong> each. The game is played in three main formats: Test matches, One Day Internationals (ODIs), and Twenty20 (T20) matches. In Test cricket, there are no over limits, and the match can last up to five days. In ODIs, each team plays a maximum of 50 overs, while in T20s, the limit is 20 overs per side. Each team takes turns batting and bowling. The main objective is to score more runs than the opponent. Runs can be scored by running between the wickets or by hitting the ball to the boundary (four runs if the ball touches the ground before the boundary, and six runs if it crosses the boundary in the air).

                            <u>Prize money</u><p>
                                =>Prize money in cricket plays a significant role in rewarding teams and players for their performance in international and domestic tournaments. In major international events like the ICC Cricket World Cup, T20 World Cup, and Champions Trophy, the International Cricket Council (ICC) offers large cash prizes to the winners, runners-up, and other participating teams based on their standings. For example, the winner of the ICC Men's T20 World Cup 2024 received over <b>USD 2 million</b> as prize money. Apart from international tournaments, franchise leagues such as the Indian Premier League (IPL) also offer substantial prize money. In IPL, the winning team typically receives around ₹20 crore, while the runners-up and other top teams also receive crores in rewards. In addition, Man of the Match, Best Batsman, Best Bowler, and Emerging Player awards come with separate cash prizes.

                                =>Over the years, several cricket teams, especially in franchise leagues like the Indian Premier League (IPL), have become defunct due to various reasons such as financial issues, legal problems, or team restructuring. Two of the earliest IPL teams to be terminated were the Kochi Tuskers Kerala and Pune Warriors India. Kochi Tuskers played only in the 2011 season before being terminated due to contract breaches. Pune Warriors India played from 2011 to 2013 but withdrew due to financial disputes with the BCCI.In 2016 and 2017, two temporary teams — Rising Pune Supergiant and Gujarat Lions — were introduced to replace the suspended franchises Chennai Super Kings (CSK) and Rajasthan Royals (RR) due to their involvement in a betting scandal. These temporary teams became defunct once CSK and RR returned in 2018.

                                    =>Cricket has a long and rich history that dates back to the 16th century in England, where it began as a simple game played by children in the countryside. The earliest known reference to cricket appeared in 1598 during a court case in England. By 1744, the first official Laws of Cricket were written, and in 1787, the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) was established, becoming the guardian of the game’s rules. Cricket began to gain international popularity in the 19th century, with the first official Test match played between Australia and England in 1877. The International Cricket Council (ICC), originally known as the Imperial Cricket Conference, was formed in 1909 to govern international cricket.

                            =>Since its inception in 2008, the IPL has crowned a champion every season. The inaugural title was won by Rajasthan Royals, who defeated Chennai Super Kings in 2008. In 2009 the Deccan Chargers upset RCB to claim the trophy. Chennai Super Kings emerged dominant in 2010 and 2011, beating Mumbai Indians and RCB, respectively. Kolkata Knight Riders broke through in 2012, defeating CSK, before Mumbai Indians began their era of supremacy with victories in 2013, 2015, 2017, 2019, and 2020—making them the joint-most successful franchise. KKR struck again in 2014 and later won in 2024, their third title. Sunrisers Hyderabad claimed their lone championship in 2016 with a win over RCB. CSK responded strongly with titles in 2018, 2021, and 2023. In a remarkable debut in 2022, the Gujarat Titans lifted the trophy. Finally, in 2025, Royal Challengers Bangalore ended their 18-year wait by defeating Punjab Kings in a nail-biting final, marking their first-ever IPL title

                            =>In cricket tournaments that follow a league or round-robin format, the league stage positions refer to the rankings of teams based on their performance during the initial phase of the competition. Each team plays a fixed number of matches, usually facing all other teams once or twice, depending on the tournament format. Teams earn points for each match: typically 2 points for a win, 1 point for a no-result or tie, and 0 points for a loss. These points are used to form the points table, where teams are ranked accordingly. If two or more teams have the same number of points, their position is determined using Net Run Rate (NRR), which is a measure of how efficiently a team scores and restricts runs.
